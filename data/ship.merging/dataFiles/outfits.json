    "description": "A miniaturized Micro-Stabilizer, produced and gifted by the Lumeshi. This is a compact energy modulation unit designed to compress spatial fluctuation fields into a steady power output. It employs phased gravitic coils and harmonic plasma inducers to convert localized space-time motion into usable energy. Human-engineered versions are typically too large to be practical, serving only as low, independent power sources for isolated systems rather than integration with a ship's main reactor. The Lumeshi miniaturized variant, however, achieves remarkable efficiency, producing stable energy from minimal spatial distortion.",
